# Forms

## Glossary

There are a number of entities that pertain to forms.

* Configurations
* Schemata
* Submissions
* Providers

### Configurations
A configuration is the highest-level construct. Submissions are posted against a configuration. Configurations also specify the automation that occurs when a form is submitted (e.g. who can see the submission; how the parent routing's data is popualted)

Any form configuration has 1 provider.
Any form configuration can have arbitrarily many schemata and submissions.

### Schemata
A submission identifies a version of the form (if only implicitly) and primarily contains the data of the form.

Any version of a form has a schema. A form's schema identifies what questions are on that version of the form, what are their captions, as well as type information about the question (e.g. is this a drop-down). This is not used today for type-checking submission data when it arrives, rather it is used when displaying form submissions to end-users within the app. Readers may see the JSON schema of a form schema [here](schemas/form-structure.yaml).

### Providers

Of all form concepts, that of Provider will be least obvious

A form's provider may be one of FormHero, Drupal or Proof. The provider layer allows for certain simplifications in retrieving schema, correlating schemas with submissions, and mapping schema's from a different form ecosystem into the proof ecosystem.

For forms built on the [FormHero platform](formhero.io), submissions contain information which identifies not only which form the submission came from, but enough information to identify which version of the form was submitted. Because all forms and versions are cloud-hosted, the Proof application is able to call-out and retrieve the schema of a submission upon submission.

For forms built using [Drupal's WebForm](https://www.drupal.org/project/webform), less automation is possible than the FormHero case (as there isn't a single, canonical domain will drupal webforms are hosted), but one can submit a schema as exported from Drupal, and it will be converted into Proof's internal schema format, the schema of which is [here](schemas/form-structure.yaml)


## Endpoints

* [Submit a form](#submit-a-form)
* [Form submission data](#form-submission-data)
* [Inspect a Schema](#inspect-a-schema)
* [Debug a submission](#submission-debug-endpoint)
    - [Example Response](#example-response)

## Submit a form 

Form submission endpoints take the form

`/forms(/:provider)(/:form_config_id)/submit`

At least one of `provider` or `form_config_id` must be present.
If `provider` and `form_config_id` are set, they must match.

### Examples: 

* `POST /forms/drupal_webform/submit`
* `POST /forms/drupal_webform/:form_config_id/submit` <- doesn't exist yet, but should
* `POST /forms/form_hero/submit` <- this form is particularly convenient for us for wiring up forms


## Form Submission Data
Work with data submitted via the form.

* `GET forms/121/submissions` will return a paginated list of all the submission for the form configuration `121`

See [form_configs](#) for a list of configured forms.  The [submission debug endpoint](#submission-debug-endpoint) will return the schema of a form submission.

__Optional query parameters:__
 - _page:_ page number to return
 - _per_page:_ number of results per page
 - form data query parameters (see below)

__Form Data Query Parameters__
The API uses path parameters to filter results from submitted form data.  Each query parameter has three elements:
* the type of query: `'filters[email][query]': 'eq`,
* criteria to evaluate `'filters[email][value]': 'me@here.com'`,
* the data type of the criteria `'filters[email][type]': 'string'`,
 

__Supported Query Types:__  
 - starts_with
 - ends_with
 - ilike
 - eq
 - ne
 - gt
 - gte
 - lt 
 - lte 
 - in
 - between 
 
 Currently default is starts_with (for most cases)

__Supported Data Type__

The value of `type` is one of the following:
* `BOOLEAN`
* `DATE`
* `DOUBLE`
* `INTEGER`
* `MONEY`
* `TEXT`
* `VARCHAR`

This is a subset of the postgres data types and is used to interpret the JSON values across all submissions.

Why the Api accepts this type modulation may be unclear.

Readers will be aware that
* the submissions themselves are JSON, so the keys are constrained to be JSON objects
* the form schema could define a stricter set of type valdiations that apply to the key

A few reasons to support this type modulation today include:
* A form's schema is expected to have revisions, some of which may change the type of a question. While we consider it a best-practice to _not_ repurpose an existing question/binding when the type changes, we don't check schemas, upon import, for this kind of consistency across versions to avoid placing this constraint upon form providers.
* The proof application uses the schema to prevent humans from inputting values that deviate from the schema, however when we receive a form submission POSTed to us via API, we do not confirm that the data conforms with the matching schema (if it exists).

We do envision a future state where this type modulation is phased out in favour of stricter type checking across schema versions and upon data POST, but don't have a timeline for this change.

_See the form schema for a details_

```json 
"email_address": {
            "id": "email_address",
            "cuid": "26e442c8-8a31-4d5f-887e-9c71c170c8a0",
            "type": "string",
            "label": "Email address",
            "binding": "email_address"
        },
````

###### Copy as cURL

``` shell
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" http://https://app.proofgov.com/api/forms/121/submissions?per_page=500&filters%5Bofficeuse.Dateentry%5D%5Btype%5D=date&filters%5Bofficeuse.Dateentry%5D%5Bvalue%5D=2020-09-23&filters%5Bofficeuse.Dateentry%5D%5Bquery%5D=gt
```

## Inspect a Schema

API for schema support is evolving.

Information on the latest schema for a form can be obtained by

* taking the submit URL for the form
* appending `/debug`
* posting an empty JSON body to it.

See the [Debug a form](#debug-a-form) section for more details.


## Debug a form

* `POST /forms/drupal-webform/:form_config_id/submit/debug`

* `POST /api/forms/drupal-webform/:form_config_id/schemata`


__Notes:__
* Has same auth setup as submit endpoint (i.e. no auth - open)
* Does _not_ persist submissions
* Response codes
  - 200 when does a match
  - would 404 if the form_config wasn't found

* Expects the same body format as the submit endpoint
* Returns, in response
  - what schema version we're matching against
  - what are all the question/bindings we know about
  - given the body you submitted, what matched
  - (we're not explicitly telling you what didn't match)
